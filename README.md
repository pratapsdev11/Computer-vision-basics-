# CV-Basics

In This repo. we have one folder [THE BASIC THREE ](THE%20BASIC%20THREE/) which consist of two files,[The Cifar_10](THE%20BASIC%20THREE/Cifar_10.ipynb) and [mnist_from_scratch](THE%20BASIC%20THREE/mnist_from_scratch_.ipynb). I directly imported  data using Kaggle API instead of downloading Data. Main motto of this is to use this repo as refrence while working on my other cv projects.
